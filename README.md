# Collaborative NGO Event Management Platform

The Collaborative NGO Event Management Platform is an open-source software designed to address the challenges faced by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in disseminating information about their drives, events, and campaigns. The platform serves as a centralized hub where NGOs can seamlessly share information about their initiatives for societal betterment. By providing a space for NGOs to post details about their work, we aim to increase visibility, coordination, and overall impact.

## Features

- **Centralized Hub:** A single platform for NGOs to share information about their drives, events, and campaigns, making it easy for interested individuals to discover and participate.
- **NGO Access:** NGOs can sign in and post details about their initiatives, including events, campaigns, and drives.
- **Volunteer Management:** The platform facilitates managing volunteer opportunities for events and drives, allowing NGOs to connect with willing participants.
- **Event Management:** NGOs can easily create and manage events, including details such as date, time, description, and required volunteers.
- **User Engagement:** Users can explore and participate in various initiatives and events hosted by NGOs.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** Node.js and MongoDB are used for server-side development and data management.
- **Frontend:** React.js is used to build a user-friendly interface for the platform.
- **APIs:** RESTful APIs are implemented to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
